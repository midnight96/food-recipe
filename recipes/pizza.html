                            <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Make the dough:</strong> In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar, yeast, and salt. Add warm water and olive oil. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Knead the dough:</strong> Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place it in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let it rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Preheat oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Shape the dough:</strong> Once risen, punch down the dough and place it on a lightly floured surface. Roll or stretch it out into your desired pizza shape (e.g., a 12-inch circle).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Add toppings:</strong> Transfer the dough to a piece of parchment paper. Brush the edges with olive oil. Spread the tomato sauce evenly, leaving a small border. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and add your favorite toppings.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Bake the pizza:</strong> Carefully slide the pizza (on the parchment paper) onto the preheated pizza stone or a baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.</li>
